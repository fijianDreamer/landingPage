I created a landing page that displays the time of day, greets the user, and asks the user what the focus is for that day. The name of the user, and the focus is saved via local storage. I used 3 personal pictures that I took myself, which are used in the background. The background image varies depending on what time of day it is, and the location of where the picture was taken is updated to reflect the correct location. I used a border box with a transparent background to make the text more legible, and it did not take away from the background. The result is a simple, yet beautiful landing page.
